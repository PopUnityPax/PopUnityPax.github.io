Pop into Unity. Build Peace Worldwide.
Project Vision Document
Version 1.1 | January 2026
Founded by: TAYTOK
Location: Znojmo, Czech Republic
Executive Summary
PopUnity Pax is a next-gen communication platform designed to foster global peace through meaningful, human-centered connections. In a world divided by echo chambers and online toxicity, PopUnity Pax flips the script: it's a social space where users "pop" into constructive dialogues, bridge divides, and pin positive actions for unity and peace ("Pax").
Unlike traditional social media that amplifies rage, PopUnity Pax uses smart design, AI guidance, and gamification to promote empathy, understanding, and real-world impact. Our mission: Turn digital interactions into bridges for peace across cultures, politics, and borders.
Target launch: MVP Q4 2026. Open-source core with sustainable monetization.
Problem Statement
